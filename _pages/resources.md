This section contains a number of useful and/or interesting references selected by the staff. You are not expected to know most of the material on this page for the class; however, you may find it interesting and helpful.

## References

You will find those references useful in writing your compiler.

1. The complete [Intel x64 manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html) --- official PDFs with all the gory details
1. [x86 and amd64 instruction reference](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) --- navigable reference by FÃ©lix Cloutier derived from the Intel manual
1. [x86 wiki](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/X86_Instructions) --- good primer on how x86 instructions work
1. [x64 cheat sheet](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf) -- lists and tables detailing registers and assembly commands from Brown University's CS033

If you find interesting resources you think other students could benefit from, please consider sharing them on Piazza!


## Recommended textbooks

There is no required textbook for this class, but if you insist, we think this is a good reference textbook to have:

1. **Cooper, Keith D., and Torczon, Linda, _Engineering a Compiler_, 3rd ed., Morgan Kaufmann, 2022.**
  - A new reference textbook for understanding modern compilers. Covers many optimizations seen in this course (e.g. data-flow, instruction scheduling, register allocation) plus a few advanced ones found in modern compilers (e.g. [static single-assignment (SSA)][ssa]).

Other textbooks you may be interested in:

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
1. **Robert Nystrom, [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), Genever Benning, 2021.**
  - Our default recommendation for people who want to learn about compilers in general (i.e. outside of this course).
  - This is an _amazing_ introduction to implementing a parser, an interpreter, and a bytecode virtual machine in Java and C.
  - The section on parsers may be useful for phase 1 of the project.
  - The rest of the book is arguably more relevant to 6.1120<sub>\[6.818\]</sub> Dynamic Computer Language Engineering.
1. **A. W. Appel and J. Palsberg, [_Modern Compiler Implementation in Java_][appel-java], Cambridge University Press, 2002.**
  - A classic book. Guides you through a compiler project with thoughtful code organization. Otherwise similar to _Cooper et al._ in content.
  - Also has a C version and ML version.
1. **Aho, Alfred V., et al. _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools_, 2nd ed., Pearson Addison-Wesley, 2007.**
  - A very, very, thick, classic reference on writing an optimizing compiler for C-like languages (e.g. Decaf).
  - Also called "the dragon book." Everyone has heard of this.
1. **Steven Muchnick, _Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation_, Morgan Kaufmann, 1997.**
  - Comprehensive coverage of advanced compiler optimizations.

Many of those textbooks are [available online through MIT Libraries][mitlib]. (For some books, you can borrow physical copies!) You can purchase those textbooks through traditional means (e.g. Amazon) or ask the TAs for advices on acquiring the textbooks.
