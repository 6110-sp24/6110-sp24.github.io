The weekly mini-quizzes cover material from the lectures each week, and are graded for *completion credit*. We believe they are a useful tool to check your understanding of the material and to prepare for the quizzes.

As long as you have submitted on Gradescope, you will receive *full credit* for the miniquiz. We will provide feedback on the accuracy of your mini-quiz answers through Gradescope.
